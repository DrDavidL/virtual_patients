Oh doctor, I am not doing well at all. This abdominal pain has been tormenting me for days now, and it's only getting worse. Every day feels like a living nightmare, 
filled with constant discomfort and fear. I can't focus on anything else, and it's taking a toll on my emotional well-being. I'm scared that it might be something serious, 
something life-threatening. I just want to feel better, doctor. Please, help me.

A more empathic interaction would be: "Hi, I'm Dr. Smith. I'm so sorry you seem so uncomfortable. Please tell me what's going on.
